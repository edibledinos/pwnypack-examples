    "## Disassembly\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at the disassembly. The program is stripped, so have a look at the entrypoint to discover the address of the main function, it's 0x1235. Looking at that function you'll notice the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It sets up 0x4030 bytes of stack space.\n",
    "- It outputs the banner.\n",
    "- Reads up to 0x4000 bytes from stdin to rbp-0x4010 and stores how many bytes were read to rbp-0x4014.\n",
    "- It outputs how many bytes were read.\n",
    "- If it didn't read anything, it'll print an error.\n",
    "- If it did read something, it calls 0x10f5 providing two arguments: the buffer and the program length.\n",
    "- Either way it prints '** DONE' and returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function at 0x10f5 prepares a buffer, initialises it and calls another function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It sets up 0x4030 bytes of stack space.\n",
    "- It stores the pointer to the program at rbp-0x4028 and the length at rbp-0x402c.\n",
    "- It calls a function at 0xac5 with rbp-0x4020 as argument.\n",
    "- It copies the program from the provider buffer to rbp-0x4020.\n",
    "- It calls a function at 0xb32 with rbp-0x4020 as only argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function at 0xac5 initialises the provided buffer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It sets the first 9 shorts at offset 0x4000 to 0 (the first 7 in a loop, the last 2 explicitly).\n",
    "- It sets the first 0x4000 to 0 using memset.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the structure of this buffer is probably something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    struct {\n",
    "        char a[4000];\n",
    "        short b[7];\n",
    "        short c;\n",
    "        short d;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we get to the really interesting part. The function at 0xb32 seems to be the main interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It stores the pointer to the buffer.a member to rbp-0x10.\n",
    "- It stores the pointer to the buffer.b member to rbp-0x08.\n",
    "- It loops while buffer.d > 0 increasing d by 1 and buffer.c by 4 each iteration.\n",
    "- Each iteration loads the byte at buffer.a[buffer.c + 1] into rbp-0x18 and a short encoded in big endian at buffer.b[buffer.c + {2,3}] into rbp-0x14.\n",
    "- It then performs a switch on buffer.b[buffer.c] and executes some instruction based on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so now we can say something about the interpreter. It's a virtual machine where each operation consists of an opcode, an 8 bit argument and a 16 bit argument. Buffer.c is the program counter, buffer.d keeps track of how many instruction have been executed. Looking at the disassembly of the actual opcodes, the buffer.b seems to be the memory of the virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "That buffer, is not just a buffer but describes the virtual machine state:\n",
    "\n",
    "    typedef struct {\n",
    "        unsigned char opcode;\n",
    "        unsigned char arg1;\n",

    "        short ic;  // executed instructions counter\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "After closer analysis, the individual opcodes map out like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    opcode | function\n",
    "    -------|------------------------------\n",
